This study shows how a ranking system can be applied to Twitter and give a ranking for users based on their influence. Through application of matrix methods, users on Twitter were ranked according to retweets, followers, and favorites. The ranking system was based on the application of the Perron-Frobenius theorem as well as an iterative method. For this particular study, a smaller data set was used due to the complexity of the ranking system as the matrices increase in size. A larger data set would also be hard to model because some users are hardly connected to twitter and don't have much information. Their data might skew the system unless a significantly large data set is analyzed. The first step was to verify the matrix was irreducible. Once the matrix was found to be irreducible, the Perron-Frobenius theorem allowed for the matrix to be manipulated with an iterative method. Traditional power iteration was used for approximation of the dominant eigenvector, and was able to determine an accurate ranking for our users.
